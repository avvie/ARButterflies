##Butterflies

In this project I experimented with ARFoundation and tested on the only ARCore enabled device that was available.

In editor it will need some modification to work: You will need to disable the RaycastComponent in the Interaction Gameobject, before you click play. 
Then go to the Spawner GameObject, after Play has been pressed, and tick the Start variable of DirectionVectorCreatorHalfSphere Component to true
